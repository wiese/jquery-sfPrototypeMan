# jquery.sfPrototypeMan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wiese/jquery-sfPrototypeMan.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wiese/jquery-sfPrototypeMan)

A jQuery plugin for the management of HTML(5) forms, with the [allow_add option](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/collection.html#allow-add) enabled, generated by **Symfony 2**.

## Demo
Use [the demo](http://wiese.github.io/jquery-sfPrototypeMan/demo/) to get a first impression of the behaviour.

## Installation

Include script *after* the jQuery library

    <script src="/path/to/jquery.sfprototypeman.js"></script>

### Minified production version

This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). If you build it, a minified version for production usage will be created at

    build/jquery.sfprototypeman.min.js

## Usage

Run

    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan();
to extend Symfony generated forms with collections that ("allow_add" option) offer the [ability to add unknown/unlimited number of sub-forms/fields of a certain type](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html#cookbook-form-collections-new-prototype).

By default all form parts detected to be "repeatable" as per the Symfony way of doing that, will be extended with the ability to add and remove them.

## Settings

Settings can be passed to sfPrototypeMan to override the *defaultOptions*, e.g.

    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan({
    	addButtonText: "Give me one more field",
    	rmButtonText: "-"
    });

## Events

You can attach listeners to sfPrototypeMan that will respond to events emitted by third-party code on the nodes handled by sfPrototypeMan, that is the elements with the prototype data attribute.

### Default listeners

By default, sfPrototypeMan integrates with **jQuery UI sortable** by listening to the *sortupdate* event and responding respectively.

### Attach more listeners

You can attach additional listeners, and thus make it integrate with third-party code in a clean fashion, like so

    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan({
    	containerListeners: {
    		myEventName: function(event) {
    			// your code reacting to myEventName
    			// "this" in here will be bound to be the SfPrototypeContainer object
    		}
    	}
    });
In this example, the event *myEventName* call on elements monitored by sfPrototypeMan will result in the anonymous callback function be called.

### Emitted events

sfPrototypeMan emits the events *prototype.elementremoved* and *prototype.added* in the given situation.

## Todo

* bumping grunt-contrib-quint (ticket?) to >0.2.2 to get qunit >=1.10.0
* more @todo in tests.js
